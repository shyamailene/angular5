					<h5 class="description">The Millennium Development Goals set forth by the United Nations at the turn of the new millennium did help the cause of gender equality and women’s empowerment throughout the developing nations. Unfortunately, the initiatives for gender equality have not fully translated into gender equity in terms of access to education, healthcare and economic opportunities for women in rural and under developed regions of the world. Violence and discrimination on women have not only been common but on the rise in many countries across the world. </h5>
